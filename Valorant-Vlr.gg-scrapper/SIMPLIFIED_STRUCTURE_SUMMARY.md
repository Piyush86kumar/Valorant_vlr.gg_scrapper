# Simplified File Structure Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a **simplified, consolidated file structure** that reduces data splitting and uses the preferred format like `vlr_detailed_player_stats_20250719_213324.csv`. The system now provides **raw scraped data** in fewer, more organized files without unnecessary fragmentation.

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

### Before (Too Many Split Files)
```
📦 ZIP contained 8 files:
├── vlr_matches.csv
├── vlr_player_stats.csv  
├── vlr_agent_utilization.csv
├── vlr_maps.csv
├── vlr_detailed_matches.csv
├── vlr_map_details.csv          ← Split unnecessarily
├── vlr_raw_player_stats.csv     ← Split unnecessarily  
└── vlr_overall_player_stats.csv ← Split unnecessarily
```

### After (Simplified Structure)
```
📦 ZIP contains 6 files:
├── vlr_matches.csv
├── vlr_player_stats.csv
├── vlr_agent_utilization.csv
├── vlr_maps.csv
├── vlr_detailed_matches.csv           ← Consolidated with map info
└── vlr_detailed_player_stats.csv     ← Preferred format (overall + map-by-map)
```

## ✅ **Preferred Format Implementation**

### Detailed Player Stats Format
Using the exact format from `vlr_detailed_player_stats_20250719_213324.csv`:

```csv
Match ID,Event,Map,Team,Player,Player ID,Primary Agent,All Agents,Rating,ACS,Kills,Deaths,Assists,K/D Diff,KAST,ADR,HS%,First Kills,First Deaths,FK/FD Diff,Attack Rating,Attack ACS,Attack Kills,Attack Deaths,Attack Assists,Attack KAST,Attack ADR,Defense Rating,Defense ACS,Defense Kills,Defense Deaths,Defense Assists,Defense KAST,Defense ADR
```

**Key Features**:
- **Overall stats**: Map = "Overall" with aggregated agent info
- **Map-by-map stats**: Individual map performance
- **All Agents column**: Shows all agents used (e.g., "Viper, Kayo")
- **Primary Agent column**: Main agent for that record
- **Complete stats**: All sides, Attack, Defense breakdowns
- **Raw data**: No aggregation or summarization

## ✅ **Consolidated Data Structure**

### 1. Basic Tournament Data (4 files)
- **`vlr_matches.csv`**: Basic match results
- **`vlr_player_stats.csv`**: Tournament player statistics
- **`vlr_agent_utilization.csv`**: Agent usage data
- **`vlr_maps.csv`**: Map information

### 2. Detailed Match Data (2 files - Consolidated)
- **`vlr_detailed_matches.csv`**: 
  - Match information + map results in single record
  - Maps Played column: "Ascent (13-11) | Bind (13-8) | Haven (13-10)"
  - No separate map details file needed

- **`vlr_detailed_player_stats.csv`**:
  - Overall player stats (Map = "Overall")
  - Map-by-map player stats (Map = specific map name)
  - All in one file using preferred format
  - 40 records with 34 columns of complete stats

## ✅ **Raw Data Guarantee**

### No Aggregation or Processing
- **Direct extraction** from scraped JSON structure
- **Original field names** preserved (k, d, a, rating, acs, etc.)
- **No calculations** or derived metrics
- **No data transformation** beyond format conversion
- **Exactly what was scraped** from VLR.gg

### Data Quality Results
